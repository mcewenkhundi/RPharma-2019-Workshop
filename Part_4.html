# Resampling Methods

.pull-left[
These are additional data splitting schemes that are applied to the _training_ set and are used for **estimating model performance**. 

They attempt to simulate slightly different versions of the training set. These versions of the original are split into two model subsets:

* The _analysis set_ is used to fit the model (analogous to the training set). 
* Performance is determined using the _assessment set_. 

This process is repeated many times. 

There are [different flavors of resampling](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/resampling.html) but we will focus on one method in these notes.

# The Model Workflow and Resampling

All resampling methods repeat this process multiple times: 

&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;img src="images/diagram-resampling.svg" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 

The final resampling estimate is the average of all of the estimated metrics (e.g. RMSE, etc).




---

# V-Fold Cross-Validation

.pull-left[

Here, we randomly split the training data into _V_ distinct blocks of roughly equal size (AKA the "folds").

* We leave out the first block of analysis data and fit a model.

* This model is used to predict the held-out block of assessment data.

* We continue this process until we've predicted all _V_ assessment blocks

The final performance is based on the hold-out predictions by _averaging_ the statistics from the _V_ blocks.

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="images/part-4-rs-diagram-1.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

_V_ is usually taken to be 5 or 10 and leave-one-out cross-validation has each sample as a block. 

**Repeated CV** can be used when trianing set sizes are small. 5 repeats of 10-fold CV averages 50 sets of metrics.

# Resampling Results

The goal of resampling is to produce a single estimate of perforamnce for a model. 

Even though we end up estimating _V_ models (for _V_-fold CV), these models are discarded after we have our performance estimate. 

Resampling is basically an _emprical simulation system_ used to understand how well the model would work on _new data_.

Each individual split object is similar to the 
`initial_split()` example.


```r
cv_splits$splits[[1]]
```

```
## &lt;1979/220/2199&gt;
```

```r
cv_splits$splits[[1]] %&gt;% analysis() %&gt;% dim()
```

```
## [1] 1979   74
```

```r
cv_splits$splits[[1]] %&gt;% assessment() %&gt;% dim()
```

```
## [1] 220  74
```

???

Note that `&lt;split [2K/222]&gt;` rounds to the thousandth and is the same as `&lt;1977/222/2199&gt;`

# Working with Preprocessing and Recipes

We'll use our last recipe along with a K-NN model? Within each analysis set:

&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;img src="images/diagram-resampling-packages.svg" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

This means that, for each resample, there are potentially different preprocessing results (e.g. Box-Cox transformations, etc.) and _this is a good thing_.

# Preparing the Recipes &lt;img src="images/purrr.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/recipes.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/dplyr.png" class="title-hex"&gt;


Our first step is the run `prep()` on the `ames_rec` recipe but using each of the analysis sets.

`recipes` has a function that is a wrapper around `prep()` that can be used to map over the split objects, prepping on the analysis set of each one:

As an example of measuring the pre-processing variability:

```r
map_dfr(cv_splits$recipes, tidy, number = 2) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::filter(terms == "Lot_Area") %&gt;% 
  slice(1:6)

# Fitting the Models &lt;img src="images/purrr.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/parsnip.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/recipes.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/dplyr.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/broom.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

A simple function is used to fit the model using the results of the recipe. 

This code will use the recipe object to get the data. Since each analysis set is used to train the recipe, our previous use of `retain = TRUE` means that the processed version of the data is within the recipe. This can be returned via the `juice()` function.

```r
parsnip_fit &lt;- function(rec_obj, model) {
  fit(model, Sale_Price ~ ., data = juice(rec_obj))

This is a little more complex. We need three elements contained in our tibble:

 * the split object (to get the assessment data)
 * the recipe object (to process the data)
 * the K-NN model (for predictions)

## 4 &lt;split [2K/220]&gt; &lt;recipe&gt; &lt;fit[+]&gt;

The function is not too bad:


```r
parsnip_metrics &lt;- function(split, recipe, model) {
  raw_assessment &lt;- assessment(split)
  processed &lt;- bake(recipe, new_data = raw_assessment)
  
  model %&gt;%
    predict(new_data = processed) %&gt;%
    # Add the baked assessment data back in
    bind_cols(processed) %&gt;% 
    perf_metrics(Sale_Price, .pred)
}
```

# Workflows 

.pull-left[
We are in the process of making a new package called "`workflows`" that bundles together the operations that go "in the model process box". This would include:

* pre-processing steps (via a recipe)
* model estimation (from `parsnip`)
* post-processing steps (cut-point optimization, calibration, etc)

A workflow would have its own `fit` function that would prepare the recipe, fit the  model, etc. A simple `prediction` function would also be available. 

This will make the code much higher-level.

# Model Tuning



---

# Tuning Parameters

There sre some models with parameters that _cannot be directly estimated from the data_. 

For example, _K_-nearest neighbors stores the training set (including the outcome). 

When a new sample is predicted, _K_ training set points are found that are most similar to the new sample being predicted. 

The predicted value for the new sample is some summary statistic of the neighbors, usually: 

* the mean for regression, or
* the mode for classification.

There is no formula that will tell you what _K_ should be. We need a way to estimate it.

# Tuning Parameters and Overfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model inappropriately picks up on trends in the training set that do not generalize to new samples. 

When this occurs, assessments of the model based on the training set can show good performance that does not reproduce in future samples.   

For example, _K_ = 1 is much more likely to overfit the data than larger values since they average more values. 

Also, how would you evaluate this model by re-predicting the training set? Those values would be optimistic since one of your neighbors is always you.

# Model Tuning

.pull-left[

Unsurprisingly, we will evaluate a tuning parameter by fitting a model on one set of data and assessing it with another. 

_Grid search_ uses a pre-defined set of candidate tuning parameter values and evaluates their performance so that the best values can be used in the final model. 

We'll use resampling to do this. If there are _B_ resamples and _C_ tuning parameter combinations, we end up fitting  `\(B \times C\)`  models (but these can be done in parallel).

# Bad news, good news


* _Bad_: By the end of the year, we should have a nice interface to tuning model and recipe parameters. 

* _Good_: For K-NN, there is a simple way of tuning the model.

For some models (e.g. PLS, boosted trees, MARS, glmnet, and others), we can make multiple predictions from the same fitted model. 

For example, if you do 100 boosting iterations with trees, you can get predictions for iterations &lt; 100 for nearly free. 

We can do this for K-NN using a function called `multi_predict()`.

# The Final Model &lt;img src="images/recipes.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/parsnip.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

Simpler models are better so I'll finalize the model using `neighbors = 11`: 


```r
# The entire training set is used for the recipe and model
ames_rec_final &lt;- prep(ames_rec)

knn_mod_final &lt;- 
  update(knn_mod, neighbors = 11) %&gt;% 
  fit(Sale_Price ~ ., data = juice(ames_rec_final))
```

Note that all of the models in the `knn` column were only used to measure performance and can be deleted.

# Workflows and Tuning Packages

Similar to the discussion about `workflow` objects, we have an upcoming package that will make tuning simple. 

Within a workflow, you will be able to tag parameters that should be optimized. 

* This can also include parameters in the recipe and post-processing operations 

A variety of tuning methods such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization will then find optimal values. 

The API will be much higher level (similar to what `caret` does).

# Other Interesting Packages for Modeling

.font90[

* For predictors with many (or novel) **categories**, supervised encodings ([`embed`](https://tidymodels.github.io/embed/)) may make the model simpler. 

* When working with **tuning parameters**, pre-defined objects can make this easier ([`dials`](https://tidymodels.github.io/dials/)) (experimental)

* When you don't want to make a prediction, **equivocal zone** data structures are available ([`probably`](https://tidymodels.github.io/probably/)).

* If you are making your own modeling package, [`hardhat`](https://tidymodels.github.io/hardhat/) makes the **behind-the-scene code** simple. 

* Feature engineering for **text data** is easy ([`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) and [`textrecipes`](https://tidymodels.github.io/textrecipes/))

* A beutiful API for hypothesis testing ([`infer`](https://infer.netlify.com/))
